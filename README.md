This is the bootstrap operating system for the pronet barebone computer. All the features for the Pronet Computer, includes three LED Control Slot, System information, contrast control, a graphics test for the display and a external Arduino Nano Control as well to run your program directly from the computer. It now becomes so simple to access these components via the LCD menu display and its 6 control buttons. We have also made security short and sleek, with the all in one pronet security chip which ensures that only that chip can unlock the computer. Along with an easy to use customizable power module with voltage regulators with support 3.3V and 5V outputs.
